Instructions: Using a text editor of your choice, write the queries that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Take screenshots of the queries and results and paste them in this document where instructed below. Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, with your Java project code, to the repository. Add the URL for this week’s repository to this document where instructed and submit this document to your instructor when complete.
Coding Steps:
Using the employees database you installed, write SQL queries that do the following (the SQL queries you write are what you will turn in for your homework):
Screenshots of Queries and Query Results (only include the last 20 rows) for each question:

1.	Show all employees who were born before 1965-01-01

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE birth_date < ‘1965-01-01’;
 
 
2.	Show all employees who are female and were hired after 1990

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE gender = ‘F’ AND hire_date > ‘1990-12-31’;

 

3.	Show the first and last name of the first 50 employees whose last name starts with F

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE ‘F%’ LIMIT 50;

 
 
4.	Insert 3 new employees into the employees table. There emp_no should be 100, 101, and 102. You can choose the rest of the data.
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (100, ‘1998-01-01’, ‘Missy’, ‘Bloom’, ‘F’, 2001-01-15’),
(101, ‘1996-05-10’, ‘Amanda’, ‘Jones’, ‘F’, ‘2010-09-21’),
(102, ‘1990-04-20’, ‘Frank’, ‘Martin’, ‘M’, ‘2011-07-27’);
 
 

5.	Change the employee's first name to Bob for the employee with the emp_no of 10023.

UPDATE employees SET first_name = ‘Bob’ WHERE emp_no = 10023;
 
 

6.	Change all employees hire dates to 2002-01-01 whose first or last names start with P.

UPDATE employees SET hire_date = ‘2002-01-01’ WHERE first_name LIKE ‘P%’ OR last_name LIKE ‘P%’;

 

7.	Delete all employees who have an emp_no less than 10000
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_no < 10000;
PRIOR to Query:
 
 
 
8.	Delete all employee who have an emp_no of 10048, 10099, 10234, and 20089.

DELETE employees WHERE emp_no = 10048; etc.
